Quine Mcluskey program
A program used to calculate minimal form of inputed variables, first you enter the size of the variable (ex. 4 if you want 1111, 5 if you want 11111).
You are then prompted to enter the total number of variables you want to minimze (ex. 8) and you are then prompted to enter a value for each Minterm.
A simplified form is shown (UDNF), and then the minimal form is shown (MDNF).
